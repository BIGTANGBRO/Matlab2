Lap Simulator developped by Thomas Williams MechEng DTM

Instructions:

You run the simulation via the Matlab files named ‘runOnceScript.m’, ‘singleParameterIterationScript.m’ and ‘multiParameterIterationScript.m’. 

The first file runs the simulation model as it is, and you can view plots using the scope outputs within the PowertrainV4.slx Simulink file. 

The other two files are scripts that run the simulation multiple times and adjust parameters (such as gear ratio, battery voltage etc) between each run. 

The last file lets you iterate multiple parameters in the same run.
